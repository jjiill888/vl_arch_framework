 vl_arch_framework  
================================================

An android gui framework that can create webview apps using url links.

Initially it was used to create the Calibre-Web Android app, and now I seem to find it can be used in all sorts of places. It has a super small packaged size and low permission requirements, so I'm opening it up for improvement!
